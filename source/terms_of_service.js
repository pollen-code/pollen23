                    We collect a variety of data to ensure Pollen is a useful platform, especially location data, as the basis for Pollen is location. 

                    Firstly, we collect personal data including pseudonym, date of birth, date joined, gender, interests, nationality, career, and education. This data is used for your profile, and it can be updated or masked at any time under modify profile: open app -> feed -> profile -> plus sign -> modify profile. If you grey out any of your information, it means others can not see it. This data is primarily to allow relationships to grow if you are someone who likes making friends or talking to people online. With this information you can connect with those around you about interests, education, etc. 

                    Secondly, we collect personal identifiers including email address and phone number. We need to collect both to create a safe method for account recovery and password changes in addition to ensuring users do not create multiple accounts. Our primary concern was to prevent users from creating two accounts and then anonymously posting to each other in the feed to stir stuff up. To combat this we ask  for your phone number, which we then verify, as it is far harder to create or obtain two verifiable phone numbers compared to two email addresses. As a result we search by phone numbers when created your account, to ensure there are not two with your phone number. We collect your email address and encrypt both it and your password, and then we force account recoveries to be done through email and username, with verification through your phone. This way, if there was ever a hack it would be nearly impossible to gain access to an individual's account. In combination with other data encryption methods, we are able to provide our users a very high level of security. 

                    Finally, we collect location data when the app is open or in the background. We do this for a variety of obvious reasons displayed on the app. Firstly, all posts need access to location to view and to create. Rooms need persistent access to data, as they monitor your data in rooms that require you to be in a local zone, and if you leave this zone Pollen needs to be able to disconnect you from receiving messages. 

                    In the future we plan to use some of our data to help inform targeted ads.

                    Pollen is remarkably serious about safety: we aim to set a standard for anonymity and safety on the internet. Given the historical trend of anonymous apps creating toxic environments ending with said appâ€™s death, we believe that creating a safe environment from day one is instrumental to long term success. As such, we have launched Pollen with more safety features from day one compared to any other anonymous social networking including: Whisper, Sarahah, Yik Yak, Tellonym, After Skool, etc.
